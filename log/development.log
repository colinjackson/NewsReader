The deal was a tax inversion, a merger that would bring the new company\\u0026#8217;s headquarters out of the US—and out of reach of many US taxes. Thanks to the comparatively high US tax rate and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/255790/how-big-business-buys-the-right-to-dodge-us-taxes/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ea corporate tax code that privileges overseas cash\\u003C/a\\u003E and profit shifting, lots of companies—especially pharmaceutical firms, which have lots of intellectual property that can be that can be steered to low-tax jurisdictions—have been trying to take advantage of the structure.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut many US politicians are unhappy about the development, which erodes the American tax base. Last month, after Burger King found a tax-inversion opportunity that would move the fast-food chain\\u0026#8217;s headquarters to Canada, the Obama administration \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/269829/did-barack-obama-just-crack-down-on-tax-inversions-or-what/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Etightened the rules\\u003C/a\\u003E for companies seeking to complete these transactions. It wasn\\u0026#8217;t clear whether this would mean merely tinkering around the edges or having enough impact to prevent the deals from going through. AbbVie\\u0026#8217;s decision to cancel its merger shows that the provisions do have some teeth; it remains to be seen if the Burger King deal or other high-profile inversions, like those planned by Medtronic and Chiquita, will be affected.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGonzalez, who thought the tax impact of his merger was of secondary importance just months ago, is now agitating for full-scale corporate tax reform. With the Republican party expecting to control the US legislature after next month\\u0026#8217;s election, it\\u0026#8217;s likely that reform proposals intended to ease companies\\u0026#8217; efforts to shift earnings overseas will gain traction, but they will find it hard to pass them while Barack Obama is still president. A long-awaited tax reform plan will likely keep waiting, at least until the results of the 2016 elections are in, barring an unexpected willingness to compromise by either party.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=284639\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/284639/the-us-government-actually-stood-up-to-a-would-be-corporate-tax-dodger/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-10-21T09:55:10-04:00\",\"category\":\"Borders\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=284639\",\"dc_creator\":\"Tim Fernholz\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/us-keeper-save.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"US-keeper-save\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/us-keeper-save.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/284639/the-us-government-actually-stood-up-to-a-would-be-corporate-tax-dodger/"], ["published_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 13:55:10 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The US government actually stood up to a would-be corporate tax dodger"], ["updated_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 14:07:39 UTC +00:00]]

About half of India\\u0026#8217;s coal reserves—the fifth largest in the world—that is available above 600 meters is low-quality coal, former Coal India chairman S. Narsing Rao \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/should-coal-be-denationalised-112082900014_1.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Epointed out\\u003C/a\\u003E in 2012. \\u0026#8220;If the private sector, including multinational corporations, is allowed to mine coal for commercial purposes, it will probably stick to producing from areas that have a low cost of production and high quality of coal,\\u0026#8221; he argued.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESince Jaitley wants to safeguard Coal India, it can\\u0026#8217;t exactly allow private firms into these lucrative coal assets and ask the state-run miner to look elsewhere.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMuch of India\\u0026#8217;s unexploited coal reserves lie in remote areas with inadequate transportation infrastructure. If private firms are asked to look at these assets, they will be forced to build expensive infrastructure to extract coal from these mines. This new transport infrastructure will then have to be linked with existing railway routes—that already moves about half of India\\u0026#8217;s coal—for further movement. Coordination between Coal India and the railways is already problematic, so adding private miners in the mix won\\u0026#8217;t make things any better.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMoreover, with Coal India selling coal at a subsidized price, it\\u0026#8217;s unclear how private firms will recover these large investments since pricing their coal according to international benchmarks will drive up cost for customers—primarily power, steel and cement sectors—who will then want to pass on the cost to the end-consumer. Industry is unlikely to react happily. And if the government forces miners to keep their prices low, private players can\\u0026#8217;t be expected to queue up.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn short, opening up the sector to private miners while fully safeguarding Coal India\\u0026#8217;s interests, is going to be a tightrope walk.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;In the current situation, it\\u0026#8217;s not right to get merchant miners into the sector,\\u0026#8221; an analyst told Quartz, requesting anonymity since the details of the policy aren\\u0026#8217;t public yet, \\u0026#8220;Till Coal India\\u0026#8217;s share (of the market) goes down, it is not possible in the next few years.\\u0026#8221; And reducing dependence on Coal India would primarily happen through an increase in captive mining.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat may be exactly what finance minister Jaitley intends on doing by streamlining the coal auction process—and by refusing to give a clear timeline on allowing private players.

He asked Polak how much of Gandhi’s teaching he thought survived in India. “Ostensibly a great deal… In reality, very little,” said Polak.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, neither India nor the Congress Party ever accepted Gandhi’s doctrine of non-violence as creed. “The Congress Party, including Nehru and other prominent leaders such as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, accepted non-violence but only as a method. With them it was an instrument of political practice, not an article of faith,” wrote Moraes.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the 56 years since his article, the situation has only worsened. Very little of the Mahatma\\u0026#8217;s politics has survived in India; we could, however, despite our reluctance, take pride in our ability to export an enduring brand. It is perhaps more relevant to the world than to India, mostly because we have chosen to take a path different from his.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat probably was a good reason why Richard Attenborough’s film on the man many Britons hated won the Oscar for best film. That probably was also the reason for the U.S. Congress to pass a special legislation allowing the Mahatma’s statute in Washington to be installed on government land.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile we, as a nation, use him on occasions of political exigencies, the world only wants more of Gandhi for his political thought.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMyriad Mahatmas\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, the metallic Mahatma is much in demand. Under a well-structured programme run jointly by India’s overseas missions, which work out the modalities of the placement of statues and busts, and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) that pays the sculptors who make the statutes, replicas of the bespectacled apostle of peace are regularly shipped to the world.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBetween 2001 and 2010, nearly 70 busts and statues of the Mahatma were sent to dozens of countries by the ICCR. That’s an average of seven a year. The bust I saw in Djibouti was sent in 2003 for installation on a street named after the Mahatma. The cigar chewing Mr. Churchill, who never regretted his long-time rival’s death, hasn’t had it so good!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Mahatma’s statue is due to be unveiled at the Parliament Square in London next year alongside those of Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela—the man who was so influenced by Gandhi as he led his people to an apartheid-free South Africa. Churchill’s statue is one of the 10 already erected at this place.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EOwning Gandhi\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHere, at home, he still has an occasional use. The stamp of moral authority that he has left on this nation means the Mahatma—though a Congress man—can be greedily adopted by other political parties when required. Modi’s effort to make him the face of his “Clean India” campaign is just another example of Gandhi’s use for political convenience.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDespite promising to build a towering statue of Patel in the run up to the general elections that swept him to power, Modi now wants his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to own “Brand Gandhi” and take over the events that mark the death and birth anniversaries of the Mahatma. Up until now, these ceremonies were the responsibility of a special committee constituted by an Act of parliament.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Mahatma’s adoption by the BJP—the political face of an organization whose members celebrated the Mahatma’s death—is ironic, but then that’s the strength of a brand that has endured the rough and tumble of time.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"edition-credit india\\\"\\u003EThis article is a part of Quartz India.

Taxes didn’t go up despite our decade-long engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. The resulting disconnect between the military and the civilian population has been cited as a source of concern by General Stan McChrystal, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and many others. MSNBC host Chris Hayes points out that the proportion of congressmen who had served in the military is now lower than for the population at large, while the reverse had been true up to 1995; we also have shown a greater propensity to project military force since around the same time.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI don’t recall a single person from my time at either Exeter or Brown who went into the armed forces. One woman the year below me at Columbia Law School joined the JAG Corps afterwards—I remember this in part because she was so unusual. For people who graduated from Brown or similar institutions, the notion of \\u0026#8220;service\\u0026#8221; tends to take less the form of \\u0026#8220;join the army\\u0026#8221; and more \\u0026#8220;go help some people.\\u0026#8221; Although Harvard, Yale, and Columbia have recently reinstated ROTC, there are more prevalent non-military service options for students, including Teach for America, the Peace Corps, City Year, and similar programs and organizations. The message is that service means working with children, teaching the poor, working at a non-profit and that sort of activity.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI’ll confess that I never realistically considered any of these options when I graduated from college in the mid-90s. I went directly to law school and became a corporate attorney. I did a few things such that I still felt somewhat pro-social (e.g., I took on a pro bono asylum case for an indigent woman, volunteered for friends’ organizations when asked), but these activities were peripheral to the basic cause of succeeding professionally.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI’m far from unique. There are a ton of young people whose goal it is to get a good job at a good firm, pay some bills, get a date, get an apartment, buy some furniture, etc. and maybe volunteer on the side. These impulses are healthy and positive. Teddy Roosevelt remarked that a man’s first duty is to provide for himself and his family; only after this has been done can he be of service to the general public. Today, with women experiencing higher educational attainment than men, I’m sure the same could be applied across gender lines.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter arriving at the law firm though, I found practicing corporate law to be a poor fit. It wasn’t because I wasn’t helping people or doing something noble. The problem for me was that my work felt fungible and pointless. I wasn’t creating any value. My reviewing documents was a transaction cost. Someone else could step in and take my place and the world would be exactly the same.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI left to co-found a startup, Stargiving.com, that used the internet to help celebrities raise money more effectively for their favorite non-profits using sponsored clicks (\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://freerice.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ethink freerice.com\\u003C/a\\u003E but with celebrities offering to meet people who clicked on their cause). The company didn’t work out, I’m sure in part because I had little idea what I was doing. I went from there to a mobile software company and a health care software company, eventually becoming the CEO of Manhattan GMAT, a test prep company that was acquired by the Washington Post.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI could say that these roles were about helping people (raising money for charities, making hospitals more efficient, helping young people achieve their goals, etc.) but that wasn’t why I did any of them. The important factor was that I thought I was making a difference for the organization each day. I just wanted to feel that my work mattered, and that I was developing in a direction I wanted to go. It was less about the activity itself and more about what I was accomplishing.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt least for me, the metrics were less about \\u0026#8220;am I helping people?”—it was more, was I creating value? Am I having an impact? Did I value the people around me? Was I becoming a better person or professional over time? If I stopped showing up, would it matter? I founded Venture for America in large part to drive our talented young people to environments where they could answer these questions in a positive way. Venture for America channels enterprising graduates to early-stage companies in Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans, St. Louis and other US cities to promote job growth and train the next generation of entrepreneurs. Our goal is to help create 100,000 new US jobs by 2025.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPeople who enlist for military service or devote their lives to the unfortunate are clearly worthy of praise and admiration. At the same time, military service isn’t a realistic option for many, and I’ve seen tons of idealistic young people go work for large non-profits and organizations only to become frustrated with their roles or burnt out. In my view, if we broaden the notion of service to include \\u0026#8220;helping organizations succeed,\\u0026#8221; \\u0026#8220;creating value,\\u0026#8221; and \\u0026#8220;generating new opportunities for yourself and others,\\u0026#8221; we’ll give many young people license to take on pursuits that are more sustainable for them and will drive society forward.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EJob creation and paths to the middle class are today what our economy and society need most. If you examine our communities, what we need as much as anything else are new companies that help enliven neighborhoods and give people meaningful avenues for personal advancement. Nothing conveys a sense of self-worth like the right opportunity. This is the new call to service—“Can you create 5, or 50, or 500 jobs for people in Detroit, New Orleans, Providence, or Baltimore?” Success will drive our ability to educate our children and many other things.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt’s time we posed a different vision of service to our young people that addresses the needs of today. Business formation and economic dynamism are at record lows. We need new businesses to drive job creation and new opportunities. If our young people decide to take on the challenge of revitalizing our country’s economy, they’ll grow to become precisely the kind of people and builders we need them to be.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe challenge that lies ahead is to make the path to entrepreneurship as well-lit and supported as other more conventional paths. Imagine if we gave each aspiring entrepreneur the same level of support and resources that currently go to aspiring lawyers and doctors, both of which often receive $100,000+ apiece in federally subsidized education loans and praise from all around them. In my experience, entrepreneurship is a lonely endeavor. We can make it less so and make it possible to serve both oneself and society.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EYou can follow Andrew on Twitter at \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/AndrewYangVFA\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E@AndrewYangVFA\\u003C/a\\u003E.

So to make these determinations, it relied solely on the data it collected in the previous year from billions of search results displayed on its website. This means that the buy-two-weeks-in-advance figure it gave us this year was actually the best time to buy last year. It also means that when Kayak said that the best time to buy in 2013 was 12 weeks out, they were off by 10 weeks.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn average, a flyer who followed Kayak\\u0026#8217;s advice last year would have paid 4.6% more for the fare than if they were able to buy at the time of lowest fares.

Does it look more like last year or 2012? After repeated requests from Quartz, Kayak declined to provide data from its search results in 2014, which could better shed light on current pricing trends. Kayak says that looking at the previous year\\u0026#8217;s data is the best way to predict when to buy, and that the 2014 data is \\u0026#8220;not actionable\\u0026#8221; because it\\u0026#8217;s incomplete and backward looking. It does not explain why data from the previous year would be any more actionable, though.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELooking at how the previous years played out, we observe only two main things that have remained consistent in Kayak\\u0026#8217;s fare data.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EBooking very early will cost you money. \\u003C/strong\\u003EThe price of a Thanksgiving-time ticket is near its most expensive in July and August.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EBooking very late will cost you money. \\u003C/strong\\u003EThe only thing more expensive than booking in August is booking less than a week before the holiday.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-284332\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"inline-image-tools\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\" class=\\\"share-button\\\" data-image-id=\\\"284332\\\"\\u003EShare\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"share-icons desaturated\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F283882%2Fwhy-kayak-has-always-been-wrong-about-the-best-time-to-book-your-holiday-flights%2Fi%2F284332%2F\\u0026text=Why+Kayak+has+always+been+wrong+about+the+best+time+to+book+your+holiday+flights\\u0026via=qz\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-twitter\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F283882%2Fwhy-kayak-has-always-been-wrong-about-the-best-time-to-book-your-holiday-flights%2Fi%2F284332%2F\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-facebook\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"help-text\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-zoom\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003ETap image to zoom\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/average-fare-of-a-thanksgiving-flight-in-the-us-in-2010-in-2012-in-2013_chartbuilder_pct.png?w=640\\\" data-retina=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/average-fare-of-a-thanksgiving-flight-in-the-us-in-2010-in-2012-in-2013_chartbuilder_pct.png?w=1024\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"/\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=283882\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/283882/why-kayak-has-always-been-wrong-about-the-best-time-to-book-your-holiday-flights/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-10-21T07:00:24-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=283882\",\"dc_creator\":\"David Yanofsky\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/rtxv0p4-e1413833992740.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"RTXV0P4\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/rtxv0p4-e1413833992740.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/283882/why-kayak-has-always-been-wrong-about-the-best-time-to-book-your-holiday-flights/"], ["published_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 11:00:24 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Why Kayak has always been wrong about the best time to book your holiday flights"], ["updated_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 14:07:39 UTC +00:00]]

It wasn\\u0026amp;#8217;t hard to switch roles and talk or drive but what was hard was understanding the logic of the code when I wasn\\u0026amp;#8217;t the only one writing it.

But when 2 people are taking turns navigating (since it was the navigator deciding most of the stuff) each person has different ways of doing things so different parts of the code are done differently.\\nTrue, we talked out the overall structure of the code ahead of time. So we were on the same page with respect to the bigger-picture logic.\\nBut when it came to the small things - like representing info as a hash or array, or looping with a while or an each - the pairing, I think, may have confused things and led to errors. \\nOverall, though, I think the pairing helped. Also, I\\u0026amp;#8217;ll get better at it the more I do it.\\nI also gained from reading the solutions to the assignments \\nI learnt the methods hahs_key?,.ord,.chr,I lert how to use || to see if something is nil as in puts array[4] || \\u0026amp;#8220;nil\\u0026amp;#8221; which will put \\u0026amp;#8220;nil\\u0026amp;#8221; if array is smaller than 5 elements.

I learnt to put array.map(\\u0026amp;amp;whatever) to run whatever code block on each part of an array and put what is returned by each code block in to 1 array. \\nSo yes, I learnt a lot from reeding the solutions.

We were tasked with putting together a journaling app (pfft, lame. DIARIES are where it\\u0026amp;#8217;s at!) that never truly left the page. Backbone feels like the logical extension of—and indeed is in large part a wrapper of—AJAX requests. Backbone is what allows us to make things we can truly call \\u0026amp;#8220;web apps\\u0026amp;#8221;: These things open on your page, and display different data by manipulating DOM elements rather than loading a new page.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Essentially, Backbone allows you to dumb down your Rails server towards being little more than an abstracted database. \\u0026lt;strong\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;This is a good thing.\\u0026lt;/em\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/strong\\u0026gt; Why?\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Well, think about it. The programs we run on our computers and apps we run on our phones are clearly more resource-intensive than the majority of basic websites. A server can be a more powerful computer than what someone has at home, but unless you\\u0026amp;#8217;re doing some serious number-crunching on your backend, the odds are that the client computer is perfectly capable of handling the actual presentational logic of your website just fine.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Which means that, on balance, the limiting factor, the \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;weakest link\\u0026lt;/em\\u0026gt; between you and the client is the \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;latency\\u0026lt;/em\\u0026gt; between the two: how long it takes to send over the data you generated. But if all you\\u0026amp;#8217;re passing around is JSON, the amount of data you have to pass around after handing down the initial Backbone javascript is way, way smaller. That means your apps will be snappier.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;And of course, semantically, they will also be actual \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;apps\\u0026lt;/em\\u0026gt;, since they live client-side, rather than server-side. Whoa.

I had an issue during the Carousel implementation where Chrome became very finnicky about recognizing the (admittedly hacky) \\u0026amp;#8220;add-two-classes-then-remove-one\\u0026amp;#8221; animation trick the App Academy Gods had us employ.

Not pretty code-wise, but it worked exactly as intended when executed.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Anyway, what I learned is that the trick to CSS is trying to figure out the least hacky way to get it to do what you want.

Doing that tutorial was like pulling teeth. The fact that the rest of the reading centered around scope and closures should give an indication of just how out-of-place that tutorial was. I suppose the objective was to give us some experience with the syntax, but there has \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;got\\u0026lt;/em\\u0026gt; to be a better way to have done that.

BDD: Behavior-driven development. I suppose it\\u0026amp;#8217;d be fair to call BDD a \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;superset\\u0026lt;/em\\u0026gt; of TDD, incorporating both the unit tests of TDD and the client centricity of a focus on page behavior rather than implementation, but functionally the variant we followed today seemed to be more the latter \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;at the expense of\\u0026lt;/em\\u0026gt; the former, rather than \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;in addition to\\u0026lt;/em\\u0026gt; it.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Still, its usefulness in web design is obvious: in a world where even the URL (oh, excuse me, I meant \\u0026amp;#8220;URI\\u0026amp;#8221;) is an abstraction of an actual location, rather than a location of its own, the web app\\u0026amp;#8217;s view is the only directly relevant aspect of the app for the user. All other aspects of the web app are only relevant in that they manage or inform the view. Testing that the page itself (the view) behaves as we expect it to, therefore, is a complete test of the functionality of the website, and to test its implementation too strenuously would be tantamount to redundancy.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;I\\u0026amp;#8217;m pretty sure this puts me squarely in the nigh-insignificantly small minority, but I enjoy writing specs. Thinking about how your program should behave before asking it to behave that way is a clean and logical workflow, and I find it makes the actual implementation much easier to hit upon naturally and elegantly. Refactoring, too, which I like to do (a lot—I think most of my pair partners hate me for this) is much less scary if you have a spec to consult to ensure that everything is behaving appropriately pre- and post-refactor.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Also, Capybara is really neat.

Very different. As compared to those that came before it, these past five days felt like a shift away from conceptual rigor and towards vocational rigor, where our primary objective was (and is) to learn how to implement basic user authentication functionality as quickly as possible. Our first auth project was a two day, 99-cats affair. Our second was a one-day solo project. Our third was a one-day pair-programming project—the one Chris and I worked together on, and that is definitely not the last of them. Our assessment on Tuesday will be a two-hour auth-off, at which point it seems we will be fully authed out and ready to party with JavaScript.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;User auth is a plain-as-day necessary skill. If you\\u0026amp;#8217;re going to want to build a web app, odds are you\\u0026amp;#8217;re going to want to store some users\\u0026amp;#8217; state in your DB. I\\u0026amp;#8217;m glad I\\u0026amp;#8217;m getting faster and faster at its implementation and I\\u0026amp;#8217;m excited to one day roll my own auth for a deployed site. But at the moment, I\\u0026amp;#8217;m definitely ready to move on. One more day of auth, and then a neat \\u0026amp;#8220;Rails Lite\\u0026amp;#8221; cloning project that I\\u0026amp;#8217;m excited to get my hands on.

As with the CatRental project, our task today was to put together a simple web app with user logins and some model data which can be accessed by certain users and not others.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;But today was yet another solo day, which allowed my always-lurking DRY-fanatic, OO-obsessive, MVC-neurotic tendencies to manifest themselves in full force. I went more-or-less nonstop from 9:00am until just about midnight in the office working on this little web app that, most likely, no one but me will ever see.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;But I\\u0026amp;#8217;m proud of it.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;I\\u0026amp;#8217;m particulary happy with the way I handled navigation links. Rather than writing out a footer on each view, I wrote a helper method in the \\u0026lt;code\\u0026gt;ApplicationHelper\\u0026lt;/code\\u0026gt; class that takes an array of links or buttons and returns the HTML for a navigation footer:\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;pre\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;code\\u0026gt;def navigation_footer(links)\\n  return nil if links.empty?\\n\\n  \\u0026amp;lt;\\u0026amp;lt;-HTML.html_safe\\n    \\u0026amp;lt;h3\\u0026amp;gt;Navigate!\\u0026amp;lt;/h3\\u0026amp;gt;\\n    \\u0026amp;lt;ul\\u0026amp;gt;\\n      \#{ links.map { |link| \\\"\\u0026amp;lt;li\\u0026amp;gt;\#{link}\\u0026amp;lt;/li\\u0026amp;gt;\\\" }.join }\\n    \\u0026amp;lt;/ul\\u0026amp;gt;\\n  HTML\\nend\\n\\u0026lt;/code\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/pre\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;This way, navigation footers can be written in a more Ruby-esque way:\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;pre\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;code\\u0026gt;\\u0026amp;lt;% nav_links = [] %\\u0026amp;gt;\\n\\u0026amp;lt;% nav_links \\u0026amp;lt;\\u0026amp;lt; link_to(\\\"Check out these BANDZ\\\", bands_url) %\\u0026amp;gt;\\n\\u0026amp;lt;% nav_links \\u0026amp;lt;\\u0026amp;lt; link_to(\\\"See the matrix\\\", users_url) if current_user.admin? %\\u0026amp;gt;\\n\\u0026amp;lt;%= navigation_footer(nav_links) %\\u0026amp;gt;\\n\\u0026lt;/code\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/pre\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Now that I look at it actually, it might\\u0026amp;#8217;ve been better off as a partial. Either way, I like the fact that I took the time to indulge my DRY instinct. It definitely didn\\u0026amp;#8217;t save me time today, but it\\u0026amp;#8217;ll pay off in the long-run.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Beyond the stuff we\\u0026amp;#8217;d already done, we had some interesting bonus tasks as well. The first was to add an \\u0026lt;code\\u0026gt;ActionMailer\\u0026lt;/code\\u0026gt; object to generate \\u0026lt;code\\u0026gt;activation_token\\u0026lt;/code\\u0026gt;s for \\u0026lt;code\\u0026gt;user\\u0026lt;/code\\u0026gt;s when they first sign up for the service. The mailer doesn\\u0026amp;#8217;t actually send, but the generated HTML email is printed in the server\\u0026amp;#8217;s console tab, and it can be used to activate a user\\u0026amp;#8217;s new account.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;The last bonus project was to add admin status for users to allow them access to a users control panel, and limit adding/removing/editing of inventory to those admins. This was made very easy by my having DRYed up my code (though it still isn\\u0026amp;#8217;t as DRY as I would like it, having just read about Concerns and Decorators\\u0026amp;#8230;), since I only had to stick a bunch of \\u0026lt;code\\u0026gt;... if current_user.admin?\\u0026lt;/code\\u0026gt; clauses in the views and \\u0026lt;code\\u0026gt;before_filter ensure_admin\\u0026lt;/code\\u0026gt; statements in the controllers. Easy-peasy.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Today I feel more like I could build a decent, fully-functional web app than I ever have before. I suppose that\\u0026amp;#8217;s the point of daily progress, but today\\u0026amp;#8217;s one of those days where I can really feel it. I\\u0026amp;#8217;m looking forward to the morning.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-10-03T00:34:00-04:00\",\"category\":\"app academy\",\"guid\":\"http://choccoli.tumblr.com/post/99031192067\"}"], ["link", "http://choccoli.tumblr.com/post/99031192067"], ["published_at", Fri, 03 Oct 2014 04:34:00 UTC +00:00], ["title", "w4d4 - its_authentic"], ["updated_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 19:34:48 UTC +00:00]]

But the underlying logic isn\\u0026amp;#8217;t particularly difficult. The life-cycle of a user seems to break down like this:\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;ul\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;User is created by form submission through https (user object, not actual human being)\\n\\n\\u0026lt;ul\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;Good practice not to actually store passwords, but encrypt them and store their hashes (I prefer \\u0026amp;#8220;hash\\u0026amp;#8221; to \\u0026amp;#8220;digest\\u0026amp;#8221;—digest sounds like a weekly magazine my mom used to get)\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;/ul\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;User object is searched at a login screen (skip if the User instance was just created)\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;If credentials match, a session is generated pairing a user_id with a randomly-generated and unique session token, which is stored in the user\\u0026amp;#8217;s (actual, human user\\u0026amp;#8217;s) cookies\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;After each subsequent request, user sends cookies back in headers of their HTTP request, session_token is matched with the one stored in cookies, and current_user is known\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;If the user logs out, destroy the new session object and set the user\\u0026amp;#8217;s session_token in their cookies to \\u0026lt;code\\u0026gt;nil\\u0026lt;/code\\u0026gt;.

The tasks were pretty straightforward: model a database of users and contacts which belong to them, with a shared contacts table to track contacts that one user would share with another. \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;(This was a bit silly: copying the contact would make much more sense. Otherwise a shared contact that the original user chose to delete would remove it from the other\\u0026amp;#8217;s contact list. I\\u0026amp;#8217;m guessing this was just to force us to work with a join table, though.)\\u0026lt;/em\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;The big new idea today was \\u0026lt;strong\\u0026gt;routing\\u0026lt;/strong\\u0026gt; and handling HTTP requests. Most of our work was more playful and less constructive today, which pushed me out of my element a bit. (That\\u0026amp;#8217;s a good thing, in case that isn\\u0026amp;#8217;t clear.)\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;I\\u0026amp;#8217;d always thought that URLs behaved exactly directories, with HTTP simply replacing \\u0026lt;code\\u0026gt;file://\\u0026lt;/code\\u0026gt;, and I suppose that once was true, but today\\u0026amp;#8217;s work pulled back the curtains on what\\u0026amp;#8217;s really going on server-side. The rails server intercepts the HTTP requests and, rather than fetching a file at what looks to be a filepath or loading a script at a given filepath and passing it some arguments, parses it out and runs different scripts depending on the intentionally semantic URL and, in some cases, the parameters it passes through.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;I suppose this is the main reason why I\\u0026amp;#8217;ve seen \\u0026amp;#8220;URI\\u0026amp;#8221; instead of \\u0026amp;#8220;URL\\u0026amp;#8221; all over the place in the Rails API: \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;the strings don\\u0026amp;#8217;t really represent locations at all anymore\\u0026lt;/em\\u0026gt;. SSHing into the server in question and running \\u0026lt;code\\u0026gt;cd \#{URI HERE}\\u0026lt;/code\\u0026gt; wouldn\\u0026amp;#8217;t get you anywhere at all.

Equally interesting, however, is that in countries where Google has a presence, but where there are no local laws mandating how maps shows national borders, Google has until now not adulterated its maps, because it is not legally obliged to do so. A fantastic case in point is the border between Thailand and Cambodia, most of which is in dispute.

In the opinion of the Moscow Times, this new law clearly violates the Russian Constitution. But the same Article 29 of that constitution limits speech in the following ways:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EThe propaganda or agitation instigating social, racial, national or religious hatred and strife shall not be allowed.

But in the strange new world of Putin\\u0026#8217;s Russia, I can almost fathom somebody arguing that showing the \\u0026#8220;wrong\\u0026#8221; borders instigates national hatred to the extent that it amounts to a call for \\u0026#8220;unsanctioned protest\\u0026#8221;. And apparently, that is \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/duma-deputy-wants-check-of-google-maps-crimea-policy/496924.html\\\"\\u003Eexactly what one Russian Deputy intends to do\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGoogle has clearly decided not to test whether this bizarre interpretation of a bizarre law would stand in court.

Showing Crimea as disputed territory would likely lead to calls for boycotts of Google\\u0026#8217;s services in Russia. Quite possibly, local Googlers also feel it is just and right for Google Maps to show Crimea as undisputedly Russian. More charitably, Google HQ might fear for the safety of its local employees. But these are not the reasons Google has given for its caving in to Russia\\u0026#8217;s increasingly dogmatic world view. Perhaps Sergei Brin, whose early experiences of persecution in Russia ultimately led him to take the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/google-co-founder-on-pulling-out-of-china-it-was-a-real-step-backward-a-686269.html\\\"\\u003Emoral high ground in China\\u003C/a\\u003E and pull the plug on Google.cn in 2010, has yet to tackle this issue.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EAnd then there is Ukraine:\\u003C/strong\\u003E Another major hint that these maps were tampered with not due to legal coercion but in order to protect Google\\u0026#8217;s existing business in an environment of charged nationalism is the fact that the Ukrainian Google Maps also differs from the international version. To the best of my knowledge (and no little Googling), Ukraine also has no law constraining the depiction of its borders on maps. And yet in Ukraine too, Google\\u0026#8217;s map aligns with the prevailing popular sentiment.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGoogle should take a stand for accuracy in every situation it is not compelled to do otherwise. Acknowledging that Crimea is disputed territory must not be made tantamount to taking sides in this conflict. Surely the Ukrainians and Russians can agree that they fundamentally disagree on who should own Crimea. That truth should be reflected on the map.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ogleearth/~4/pauR_x5u4Dw\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\"/\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://ogleearth.com/2014/04/what-does-crimea-tell-us-about-google/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-04-14T20:16:08-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://ogleearth.com/?p=2829\",\"dc_creator\":\"Stefan Geens\",\"feedburner_origLink\":\"http://ogleearth.com/2014/04/what-does-crimea-tell-us-about-google/\"}"], ["link", "http://feeds.ogleearth.com/~r/ogleearth/~3/pauR_x5u4Dw/"], ["published_at", Tue, 15 Apr 2014 00:16:08 UTC +00:00], ["title", "What does Crimea tell us about Google?"], ["updated_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 19:37:21 UTC +00:00]]

I don\\u0026#8217;t know how long this imagery has been there, but since there hasn\\u0026#8217;t (yet) been an announcement on \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://google-latlong.blogspot.com\\\"\\u003EGoogle Lat Long blog\\u003C/a\\u003E, I\\u0026#8217;m assuming this is a quite recent addition. To see the imagery at its best, turn off the water surface layer. The images are quite contrasty, so you may want to turn up the brightness of your screen.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne thing to keep in mind: The search locations far to the south may still be relevant for finding floating debris, even if the bulk of the wreck has sunk much further north, due to prevailing currents.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ogleearth/~4/oFd-3zD4DKM\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\"/\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://ogleearth.com/2014/04/mh370-google-adds-satellite-search-imagery-to-google-earth-black-box-heard/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-04-05T13:59:03-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://ogleearth.com/?p=2816\",\"dc_creator\":\"Stefan Geens\",\"feedburner_origLink\":\"http://ogleearth.com/2014/04/mh370-google-adds-satellite-search-imagery-to-google-earth-black-box-heard/\"}"], ["link", "http://feeds.ogleearth.com/~r/ogleearth/~3/oFd-3zD4DKM/"], ["published_at", Sat, 05 Apr 2014 17:59:03 UTC +00:00], ["title", "MH370: Google adds satellite search imagery to Google Earth; black box heard?"], ["updated_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 19:37:21 UTC +00:00]]

But it does label a specific place at a specific time: MH370, at 02:22 MYT, at or even beyond the MEKAR waypoint. The green trace \\u0026#8220;line\\u0026#8221; to the left of the annotated circle connects the VAMPI waypoint (previously named as a waypoint for MH370) to MEKAR. A route from IGARI on the other side of the Malaysian peninsula to VAMPI and then on to MEKAR would be a straighter route than the previously mooted one, which had MH370 turn a sharp right at VAMPI to GIVAL — a turn of more than 90 degrees — which always looked somewhat odd. (If these waypoints sound confusing to you, do read \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://ogleearth.com/2014/03/flight-mh370-search-data-in-google-earth/\\\"\\u003Ethis post\\u003C/a\\u003E for context.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne thing that aligning the photo with the SkyVector screenshot lets us do is notice that the green \\u0026#8220;line\\u0026#8221; and the annotation arrow extends slightly beyond MEKAR. If so, MH370 was on its way to NILAM — where its path would have crossed route P627, which skirts past the northern edge of Sumatra and into the Indian Ocean in a WSW direction. The last known bearing of MH370 is thus far less suggestive of a northerly route.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf we now connect the dots, from the position at 01:02 MYT as plotted by FlightAware, to IGARI, to VAMPI and then on to just past MEKAR at 02:22 MYT, we get a distance of roughly 1090km (see the KMZ file to check), flown in 80 minutes. That\\u0026#8217;s a speed of 820km/h, approximately, which is feasible.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cdel\\u003EWhat about that circle annotation in the photograph and the green \\u0026#8220;line\\u0026#8221; to the right? Absent an official account from the press conference, here\\u0026#8217;s my take: The circle is meant to highlight empty space, and thus show that the two green lines are two separate tracks from 2 separate planes. That would also explain the second arrow annotation on the right, which presumably leads to a label for another plane. Note too that these two green \\u0026#8220;lines\\u0026#8221; have slightly different bearings. But if anyone has an official clarification, I would love to hear it.\\u003C/del\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUPDATE: Keith Ledgerwood was able to convince me, with images not in the public domain, that the second arrow notation referred to the same track.

Welcome to the WebGL wars: \\u003C/strong\\u003EGoogle is using this project to promote Chrome\\u0026#8217;s superior support of WebGL, a web standard for 3D visualizations in the browser. But whereas all the main desktop browsers today \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://caniuse.com/webgl\\\"\\u003Esupport WebGL\\u003C/a\\u003E to some extent, the real differentiation occurs on mobile devices: Android\\u0026#8217;s Chrome browser \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/01/28/googles-new-build-with-chrome-website-turns-your-web-browser-into-a-box-of-legos/\\\"\\u003Esupports WebGL\\u003C/a\\u003E whereas iOS browsers do not. Although iPhones are \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://atnan.com/blog/2011/11/03/enabling-and-using-webgl-on-ios\\\"\\u003Etechnically capable of running WebGL\\u003C/a\\u003E, Apple has chosen not to deploy the technology.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI\\u0026#8217;ve long wondered why: Perhaps Apple is afraid that if robust 3D tools for the mobile browser become a standard, developers will have less of a motivation to build iPhone apps, which bolster the App store\\u0026#8217;s competitive advantage. A more generous explanation would be that Apple has simply been waiting for enough newish WebGL-capable iPhones to be in use before switching on the technology for everyone.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn any case, we at \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://soderhavet.com/en/\\\"\\u003ESöderhavet\\u003C/a\\u003E would love to have WebGL become a ubiquitous standard on mobile devices; we have pitches waiting for clients as soon as the technology works on both major smartphone platforms.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003E2. Déjà vu: \\u003C/strong\\u003EGoogle has been here before. Back in 2006, it acquired \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.sketchup.com\\\"\\u003ESketchUp\\u003C/a\\u003E, a 3D modeling application, made it free, and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://help.sketchup.com/en/article/36241\\\"\\u003Eadded tools\\u003C/a\\u003E to build and deploy buildings in Google Earth. This was part of Google\\u0026#8217;s strategy to populate its maps with realistic models of the built environment — by having an army of volunteers make them. The result was a enthusiastic community of builders, though it never achieved a critical mass of users. Soon, a far more scalable way of digitizing the built environment emerged, with low-flying airplanes simply making \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://ogleearth.com/2008/11/c3s-3d-oslo-like-birds-eye-view-but-with-tilt-rotate-and-zoom/\\\"\\u003E3D scans of cities\\u003C/a\\u003E. In 2012 Google sold Sketchup and the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/\\\"\\u003EGoogle 3D Warehouse\\u003C/a\\u003E to Trimble.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003E3. Vectors vs blocks: \\u003C/strong\\u003EOne reason SketchUp didn\\u0026#8217;t achieve a critical mass of adoption is that while it was far easier to use than other modeling tools, it still had a relatively steep learning curve. In this way it resembles \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://secondlife.com\\\"\\u003ESecond Life\\u003C/a\\u003E, which also provides vector-based tools for building in 3D. \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://minecraft.net\\\"\\u003EMinecraft\\u003C/a\\u003E first cracked the code for mass adoption: Abandon vector-based building in favor of discrete block-based construction — it doesn\\u0026#8217;t provide the same level of realism, but it is much easier to use, and that turns out to be a far more important prerequisite for widespread adoption.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe analogy is obvious: \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://soderhavet.com/bl/2013/10/15/two-reasons-why-minecraft-is-succeeding-where-second-life-failed/\\\"\\u003EWhat Second Life is to Minecraft\\u003C/a\\u003E, Sketchup + Google Earth is to Lego + Google Maps.
